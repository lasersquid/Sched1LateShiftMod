# LateShift

Allows employees to work past 4AM and without an assigned bed or locker. Autopay employees and configure whether pay is deducted from cash or your bank account.


## Configuration

The configuration file is LateShiftSettings.json, and is generated in Schedule I's UserData directory when the mod is run for the first time. It can easily be edited by hand with any text editor (eg, Notepad). The default mod configuration is to allow employees to work past 4AM, and to withdraw employee pay from cash.


## Compatibility

This mod is not compatible with other mods that affect employee working hours or autopay.
